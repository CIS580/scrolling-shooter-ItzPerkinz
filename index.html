    <h2>Instructions <br /><br />
      Control your ship with W,A,S,D or UP,DOWN,RIGHT,LEFT. Use the mouse click to shoot weak bullets at enemies. (A known bug is that the bullets only work when you are moving forwards or backwards. I don't know why.) Use SPACE to shoot secondary weapon. <br /><br />
      Getting hit loses one life or consumes your armor. After being hit you are invulnerable for a few seconds (to regain your composure). You are, however, unable to shoot during this time.
      Hitting enemies and destroying them gets you points. The more enemies you kill the faster they respawn (faster kills == higher scores). When the timer in the bottom left runs out, the boss will spawn. Kill him and you will advance to the next level. Beat three levels and win the game.
      <br /><br /> The colored cubes are upgrades.
      <br />Yellow -- Gives armor that absorbs one harmful shot.
      <br />Blue -- Upgrades your secondary weapon from missiles to lasers. Both do the same damage, but lasers fire and move much faster. (Higher DPS)
      <br />Orange -- Restores 1 health and 1 missile. <br /><br />
      The enemies all act differently... but you'll learn that for yourself.
